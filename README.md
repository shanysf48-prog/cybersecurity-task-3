## 📈 CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)

CVSS is used to measure the severity of vulnerabilities on a scale from 0 to 10:
- 0–3.9 → Low
- 4.0–6.9 → Medium
- 7.0–8.9 → High
- 9.0–10 → Critical

- Applied missing system patches
- Disabled unnecessary services
- Configured firewall rules properly
